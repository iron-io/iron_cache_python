------------------------

This package wraps the IronCache API. It provides a simple and intuitive 
way to interact with the IronCache service.

IronCache is a service provided by Iron.io. It is a temporary key/value 
storage mechanism built on cloud providers. It provides a cache that 
is reliable and scales based on demand, without requiring developers to 
provision servers themselves."""
